        <b>My love for the simple Almond</b>
        <br>
        My dear almond, you are my love, you are my life, you are my only thought
        <br>
        When i am lonely and in pain, you give me joy and take my sorrow away
        <br>
        Although you are inanimate and dead. my love remains for you as the fields are dead and my hands are cold
        <br>
        You make me bold
    </p>
